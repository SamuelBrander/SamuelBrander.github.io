    <h1>Local swiss students design 80s aesthetic website for fun, great success</h1>
    <p>When two swiss IT students decided to study ahead for some upcoming courses,
    opting to practice the learned skills in HTML, CSS, React.js and SASS by creating
    a website rife with 80s nostalgia (<a href="index.html">link</a>), the results were incredible.
    One student described feeling great joy from once again using their IT skills in
    a creative, hands-on manner after a semester of what they felt were
    excessively theory-heavy courses that entirely forewent coding practice.</p>
