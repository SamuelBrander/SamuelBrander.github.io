    <h1>Heckin good local pupper found to be extremely large and fluffy</h1>
    <p>A video of a rather massive alaskan malamute pupper recently went viral
    on reddit
    (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/md0s90/huge_alaskan_malamute/">link</a>),
    causing many remarks admiring the sheer size of that lad.</p>

    <h1>Local swiss students design 80s aesthetic website for fun, great
      success</h1>
    <p>When two swiss IT students decided to study ahead for some upcoming
      courses, opting to practice the learned skills in HTML, CSS, React.js and
      SASS by creating a website rife with 80s nostalgia
      (<a href="index.html">link</a>), the results were incredible. One student
      described feeling great joy from once again using their IT skills in a
      creative, hands-on manner after a semester of what they felt were
      excessively theory-heavy courses that entirely forewent coding practice.
      The second student was not yet available for an interview because he was
      busy practicing his html and css skills using paid teaching aids as he is
      used to paying for. One can deduce the reason for this after attending
      some of the finest lectures the swiss students have to attend.</p>

    <h1>Time traveler arrives to warn of dire future, refuses to elaborate
      further, leaves</h1>
    <p>Locals were surprised when a DeLorean appeared out of thin air in front
      of them this afternoon. They were taken by even more surprise as its
      driver apathetically exited the car and shambled over to a supermarket to
      grab a limited-edition one-litre bottle of a local supermarket's budget
      option energy drink and as many bars of chocolate as she could carry,
      explaining that in her future, the supermarket had already removed this
      caffeinated product from their lineup, and chocolate was no longer a
      thing as a consequence of the climate crisis. Whilst paying for a truly
      unholy amount of junk food, she went on to describe how "everything sucks
      forever" in the future, and how nostalgia from eating junk food from the
      time period where things were somewhat less terrible was now the only way
      for her to feel any sliver of joy in life. Clearly tired of the sudden
      attention of the crowd, she hopped back into her DeLorean and disappeared
      as quickly as she had arrived, leaving witnesses puzzled.</p>

    <h1>Sports car driver club demands immediate lifting of traffic laws</h1>
    <p>A club advocating for the interests of sports car fans and drivers has
      published an article demanding that all traffic laws be lifted, given
      that deaths caused by traffic incidents were at an all time low, and that
      being dictated where you can drive, when, and how fast, was an
      inappropriate infringement on their civil liberties. Specifically, the
      club named traffic lights, speed limits, and mandatory seatbelts as key
      measures they were incontent with. When confronted with the possible
      increase in injuries or deaths in road accidents, they recommended that
      traffic safety be shifted more towards individual responsibility of every
      person choosing to participate in traffic. "There is no absolute safety.
      We should learn to live with that. If you're paranoid, just stay at home."

    <h1>Junk food vegan finishes marathon, says he did it "just to flex on the
      haters"</h1>
    <p>One particular participant in a local marathon race caught onlooker's
      attention after finishing the race wearing a shirt with the message
      "Proud junk food vegan", and replenishing lost calories by devouring an
      entire can of pringles at a shocking speed. Journalists inquired as to
      his motivations for running the race, to which the junk food vegan
      replied:
    </p>
    <p>"Honestly, it was mostly just to flex on the haters. You see, a few
      years ago I decided to become a vegan, and immediately people started
      telling me how unhealthy this way of eating was, and how I was going to
      become all malnourished, weak, and underweight. So I decided to run
      really far just to flex on them. I started running in the spring after
      going vegan in the winter, and I realized that my performance improved
      massively, after only 3 runs I beat my previous distance record of 14 km
      by running a half marathon. That day, I decided that I wanted to, one
      day, run a full marathon. So I started training. Oh, and also, vegan junk
      food is literally my only coping strategy for dealing with my chronic
      existential crisis stemming from factors like the unresolved climate
      crisis, and all those calories have to go somewhere."</p>
    <p>The interview was then abruptly ended as a crowd of cheering people
      approached and called for some celebrations, after which the junk food
      vegan excused himself, saying he felt thirsty for some healthy fermented
      barley juice.</p>
